# Data-Science-Workflows

## Table of contents : 

In this repo I collect sample Data Science workflows and explain them step by step. You can find a single project in each folder. 

* Workflow_1
* Workflow_2
* Technologies & Packages 

### Workflow_1

In this workflow I demonstrate a typical web-scraping and API handling in data science, with some visualizations and creating databases. This was part of a project designed to demonstrate the different steps required in a data science project, from data gathering to storage to cleaning and visualizations. This does not cover inference beyond descriptives, but should give a good idea of what these types of tasks can entail. 


### Workflow_2

In this workflow I demonstrate mostly data-collection with automated scraping for open-ended questions. This workflow is intended to show one route which could have been taken to answer the question as a template, not an exhaustive length. When working on these projects I realized that it was key to make justifiable decisions quickly and work with what these decisions entail, rather than plan out all the possible stepsâ€”there is often no time for that! I use a variety of data sources, and implement the database and data-storage skills from the previous workflow, which should give an idea of how these skills can be implemented in very different contexts.
