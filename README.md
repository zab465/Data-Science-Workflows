# Data-Science-Workflows
In this repo I collect sample Data Science workflows and explain them step by step. You can find a single project in each folder.
They can be used as a templates for Social Science projects, or for demonstration of how to use common R packages (I include a list of these further down). 

* RSelenium
* rvest
* RSQLite
* httr
* DBI
* xml2
* tmap
* ggplot2

This repository contains two projects: 
* Workflow_1 which contains: 
  * A workflow of data collection (automated web-scraping, API, packaged API) and data analysis (SQL, tmap)
  * A relational database which stores the tables used in the analysis
  * A csv file of some of the data
 
* Workflow_2 which contains: 
  * A workflow of data collection (automated web-scraping, packaged API) and data analysis (SQL, ggplot)
  * A relational database which stores the tables used in the analysis
  * A csv file of some other data
